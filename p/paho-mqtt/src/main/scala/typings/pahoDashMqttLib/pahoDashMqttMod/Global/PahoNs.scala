    * Send and receive messages using web browsers.
    * <p>
    * This programming interface lets a JavaScript client application use the MQTT V3.1 or
    * V3.1.1 protocol to connect to an MQTT-supporting messaging server.
    *
    * The function supported includes:
    * <ol>
    * <li>Connecting to and disconnecting from a server. The server is identified by its host name and port number.
    * <li>Specifying options that relate to the communications link with the server,
    * for example the frequency of keep-alive heartbeats, and whether SSL/TLS is required.
    * <li>Subscribing to and receiving messages from MQTT Topics.
    * <li>Publishing messages to MQTT Topics.
    * </ol>
    * <p>
    * The API consists of two main objects:
    * <dl>
    * <dt><b>{@link Paho.MQTT.Client}</b></dt>
    * <dd>This contains methods that provide the functionality of the API,
    * including provision of callbacks that notify the application when a message
    * arrives from or is delivered to the messaging server,
    * or when the status of its connection to the messaging server changes.</dd>
    * <dt><b>{@link Paho.MQTT.Message}</b></dt>
    * <dd>This encapsulates the payload of the message along with various attributes
    * associated with its delivery, in particular the destination to which it has
    * been (or is about to be) sent.</dd>
    * </dl>
    * <p>
    * The programming interface validates parameters passed to it, and will throw
    * an Error containing an error message intended for developer use, if it detects
    * an error with any parameter.

      * The JavaScript application communicates to the server using a {@link Paho.MQTT.Client} object.

      * Most applications will create just one Client object and then call its connect() method,
      * however applications can create more than one Client object if they wish.
      * In this case the combination of host, port and clientId attributes must be different for each Client object.
      *
      * The send, subscribe and unsubscribe methods are implemented as asynchronous JavaScript methods
      * (even though the underlying protocol exchange might be synchronous in nature).
      * This means they signal their completion by calling back to the application,
      * via Success or Failure callback functions provided by the application on the method in question.
      * Such callbacks are called at most once per method invocation and do not persist beyond the lifetime
      * of the script that made the invocation.
      *
      * In contrast there are some callback functions, most notably {@link onMessageArrived},
      * that are defined on the {@link Paho.MQTT.Client} object.
      * These may get called multiple times, and aren't directly related to specific method invocations made by the
