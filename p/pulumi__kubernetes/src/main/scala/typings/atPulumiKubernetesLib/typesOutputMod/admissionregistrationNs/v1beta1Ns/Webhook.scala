    * NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the webhook on an object based on whether the

    * matching is performed on object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster scoped
    * resource, it never skips the webhook.
    *
    * For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not associated with
    * "runlevel" of "0" or "1";  you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": {
    *   "matchExpressions": [
    *     {

    *       ]

    *   ]
    * }
    *
    * If instead you want to only run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is associated
    * with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging"; you will set the selector as follows:
    * "namespaceSelector": {
    *   "matchExpressions": [
    *     {
    *       "key": "environment",
    *       "operator": "In",

    *         "staging"
    *       ]

    * }
    *
    * See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more
    * examples of label selectors.
    *
    * Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything.
