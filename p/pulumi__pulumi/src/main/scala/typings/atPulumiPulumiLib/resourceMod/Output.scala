    * Transforms the data of the output with the provided func.  The result remains a
    * Output so that dependent resources can be properly tracked.
    *
    * 'func' is not allowed to make resources.
    *
    * 'func' can return other Outputs.  This can be handy if you have a Output<SomeVal>
    * and you want to get a transitive dependency of it.  i.e.
    *
    * ```ts
    * var d1: Output<SomeVal>;
    * var d2 = d1.apply(v => v.x.y.OtherOutput); // getting an output off of 'v'.
    * ```
    *
    * In this example, taking a dependency on d2 means a resource will depend on all the resources
    * of d1.  It will *not* depend on the resources of v.x.y.OtherDep.
    *
    * Importantly, the Resources that d2 feels like it will depend on are the same resources as d1.
    * If you need have multiple Outputs and a single Output is needed that combines both
    * set of resources, then 'pulumi.all' should be used instead.
    *
    * This function will only be called execution of a 'pulumi update' request.  It will not run
    * during 'pulumi preview' (as the values of resources are of course not known then). It is not
    * available for functions that end up executing in the cloud during runtime.  To get the value
    * of the Output during cloud runtime execution, use `get()`.

    * or preview execution this must not be called (and will throw).  This is because doing so
    * would allow Output values to flow into Resources while losing the data that would allow
    * the dependency graph to be changed.
