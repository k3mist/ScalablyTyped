/**
  * Interface which provides access to webRequest events on the guest page.
  * @see[chrome.webRequest]{@link http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/webRequest}
  * extensions API for details on webRequest life cycle and related concepts.
  *
  * To illustrate how usage differs from the extensions webRequest API,
  * consider the following example code which blocks any guest requests
  * for URLs which match *://www.evil.com/ *:
  * @example
  * webview.request.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
  *   function(details) { return {cancel: true}; }, {urls: ['*://www.evil.com/ *']}, ['blocking']);
  * @description
  * Additionally, this interface supports declarative webRequest rules through onRequest and onMessage events.
  * @see[Docs]{@link http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/declarativeWebRequest.htmldeclarativeWebRequest}
  * @description
  * Note that conditions and actions for declarative webview webRequests should be instantiated
  * from their chrome.webViewRequest.* counterparts. The following example code declaratively
  * blocks all requests to 'example.com' on the webview myWebview:
  * @example const rule = { conditions: [ new chrome.webViewRequest.RequestMatcher({ url: { hostSuffix: 'example.com' } }) ], actions: [ new chrome.webViewRequest.CancelRequest() ] }; myWebview.request.onRequest.addRules([rule]);
