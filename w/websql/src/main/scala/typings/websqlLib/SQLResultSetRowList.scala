/** SQLResultSetRowList objects have a length attribute that must return the number of
  * rows it represents (the number of rows returned by the database). This is the length.
  * Fetching the length might be expensive, and authors are thus encouraged to avoid using
  * it (or enumerating over the object, which implicitly uses it) where possible.
  * The object's supported property indices are the numbers in the range zero to length-1,
  * unless the length is zero, in which case there are no supported property indices.
  * The item(index) attribute must return the row with the given index index.
  * If there is no such row, then the method must return null.
  *
  * Each row must be represented by a native ordered dictionary data type. In the
  * JavaScript binding, this must be Object. Each row object must have one property
  * (or dictionary entry) per column, with those properties enumerating in the order
  * that these columns were returned by the database. Each property must have the
  * name of the column and the value of the cell, as they were returned by the database
