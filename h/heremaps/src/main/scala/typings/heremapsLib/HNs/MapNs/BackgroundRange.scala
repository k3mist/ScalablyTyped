  * It defines the number of lower and higher zoom levels, where cached content of the base map is rendered while content of the current zoom level is still loading.
  * Example: if range was set to {lower: 3, higher: 2} and current level is 10 then rendering engine will try to display cached tiles from lower zoom levels 7, 8, 9 and higher levels 11 and 12.
  * @property lower {number} - The number of lower zoom levels to take into account, default is 0
  * @property higher {number} - The number of higher zoom levels to take into account, default is 0
