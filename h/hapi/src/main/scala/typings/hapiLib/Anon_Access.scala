    *     configuration. If the route uses dynamic scopes, the scopes are constructed against the request.query, request.params, request.payload, and request.auth.credentials which may or may
    *     not match between the route and the request's route. If this method is called using a request that has not been authenticated (yet or not at all), it will return false if the route
    *     requires any authentication.
