  trait AliasTarget extends js.Object {
    /**
      *  Alias resource record sets only: The value that you specify depends on where you want to route queries:  CloudFront distribution  Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you created your distribution. Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of the resource record set. For example, if the name of the resource record set is acme.example.com, your CloudFront distribution must include acme.example.com as one of the alternate domain names. For more information, see Using Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.  For failover alias records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for both the primary and secondary records. A distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have the same name, and you can't include the same alternate domain name in more than one distribution.    Elastic Beanstalk environment  If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes the region that you deployed the environment in, you can create an alias record that routes traffic to the environment. For example, the domain name my-environment.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com is a regionalized domain name.   For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't include the region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of an alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root domain name. For example, if your domain name is example.com, you can create a record that routes traffic for acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create a record that routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.  For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the CNAME attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the value of the CNAME attribute:    AWS Management Console: For information about how to get the value by using the console, see Using Custom Domains with AWS Elastic Beanstalk in the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide.    Elastic Beanstalk API: Use the DescribeEnvironments action to get the value of the CNAME attribute. For more information, see DescribeEnvironments in the AWS Elastic Beanstalk API Reference.    AWS CLI: Use the describe-environments command to get the value of the CNAME attribute. For more information, see describe-environments in the AWS Command Line Interface Reference.    ELB load balancer  Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. Get the DNS name by using the AWS Management Console, the ELB API, or the AWS CLI.     AWS Management Console: Go to the EC2 page, choose Load Balancers in the navigation pane, choose the load balancer, choose the Description tab, and get the value of the DNS name field.  If you're routing traffic to a Classic Load Balancer, get the value that begins with dualstack. If you're routing traffic to another type of load balancer, get the value that applies to the record type, A or AAAA.    Elastic Load Balancing API: Use DescribeLoadBalancers to get the value of DNSName. For more information, see the applicable guide:   Classic Load Balancers: DescribeLoadBalancers    Application and Network Load Balancers: DescribeLoadBalancers       AWS CLI: Use describe-load-balancers to get the value of DNSName. For more information, see the applicable guide:   Classic Load Balancers: describe-load-balancers    Application and Network Load Balancers: describe-load-balancers       Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a static website  Specify the domain name of the Amazon S3 website endpoint that you created the bucket in, for example, s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com. For more information about valid values, see the table Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Website Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. For more information about using S3 buckets for websites, see Getting Started with Amazon Route 53 in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.   Another Route 53 resource record set  Specify the value of the Name element for a resource record set in the current hosted zone.  If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as the zone apex), you can't specify the domain name for a record for which the value of Type is CNAME. This is because the alias record must have the same type as the record that you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't supported even for an alias record.

    /**
      *  Applies only to alias, failover alias, geolocation alias, latency alias, and weighted alias resource record sets: When EvaluateTargetHealth is true, an alias resource record set inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource, such as an ELB load balancer or another resource record set in the hosted zone. Note the following:  CloudFront distributions  You can't set EvaluateTargetHealth to true when the alias target is a CloudFront distribution.  Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains  If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in DNSName and the environment contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set EvaluateTargetHealth to true and either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other available resources that are healthy, if any.  If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special requirements.  ELB load balancers  Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:    Classic Load Balancers: If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in DNSName, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. If you set EvaluateTargetHealth to true and either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other resources.    Application and Network Load Balancers: If you specify an ELB Application or Network Load Balancer and you set EvaluateTargetHealth to true, Route 53 routes queries to the load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are associated with the load balancer:   For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target group that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target group contains only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy, and Route 53 routes queries to other resources.   A target group that has no registered targets is considered healthy.      When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing health checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not create Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load balancer.    S3 buckets  There are no special requirements for setting EvaluateTargetHealth to true when the alias target is an S3 bucket.  Other records in the same hosted zone  If the AWS resource that you specify in DNSName is a record or a group of records (for example, a group of weighted records) but is not another alias record, we recommend that you associate a health check with all of the records in the alias target. For more information, see What Happens When You Omit Health Checks? in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.   For more information and examples, see Amazon Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

      * Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for IPAddress.  If you specify a value for IPAddress: Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header for all health checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you want Route 53 to perform health checks. When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the Host header:   If you specify a value of 80 for Port and HTTP or HTTP_STR_MATCH for Type, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.    If you specify a value of 443 for Port and HTTPS or HTTPS_STR_MATCH for Type, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.   If you specify another value for Port and any value except TCP for Type, Route 53 passes FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port to the endpoint in the Host header.   If you don't specify a value for FullyQualifiedDomainName, Route 53 substitutes the value of IPAddress in the Host header in each of the preceding cases.  If you don't specify a value for IPAddress : Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval that you specify for RequestInterval. Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.  If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName, the health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.  If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by FullyQualifiedDomainName, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).  In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName matches the name of the resource record sets and you then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable.  In addition, if the value that you specify for Type is HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP_STR_MATCH, or HTTPS_STR_MATCH, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header, as it does when you specify a value for IPAddress. If the value of Type is TCP, Route 53 doesn't pass a Host header.

Note the following:   If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Route 53 always considers this health check to be unhealthy.

If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Route 53 sends a DNS request to resolve the domain name that you specify in FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval that you specify in RequestInterval. Using an IP address returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint. Use one of the following formats for the value of IPAddress:     IPv4 address: four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example, 192.0.2.44.    IPv6 address: eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345. You can also shorten IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example, 2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345.

For example, if you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of 192.0.2.111, create a resource record set with a Type of A and a ContinentCode of AF.  Creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is not supported.  If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example, one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource. You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic location. The value * in the CountryCode element matches all geographic locations that aren't specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type elements.  Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses aren't mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven continents, Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value of CountryCode is *, which handles both queries that come from locations for which you haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you don't create a * resource record set, Route 53 returns a "no answer" response for queries from those locations.

      * If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in response to a DNS query only when the status of a health check is healthy, include the HealthCheckId element and specify the ID of the applicable health check. Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one of the following:   By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health check   By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health checks)   By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric health checks)    Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint that is specified in the resource record set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in the Value element. When you add a HealthCheckId element to a resource record set, Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in the health check.   For more information, see the following topics in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide:    How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy     Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover     Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone     When to Specify HealthCheckId  Specifying a value for HealthCheckId is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in the following configurations:    Non-alias resource record sets: You're checking the health of a group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for all the resource record sets.  If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with. If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set. If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.     Alias resource record sets: You specify the following settings:   You set EvaluateTargetHealth to true for an alias resource record set in a group of resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).    You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.   You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.    If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with. If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the alias resource record set.  The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration, associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource record sets.     Geolocation Routing  For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for North America, and a resource record set that has * for CountryCode is *, which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:   The United States   North America   The default resource record set    Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name  If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).  Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:   Create a health check that has the same value for FullyQualifiedDomainName as the name of a resource record set.   Associate that health check with the resource record set.

If you don't associate a health check with a multivalue answer record, Route 53 always considers the record to be healthy.   Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records; if you have eight or fewer healthy records, Route 53 responds to all DNS queries with all the healthy records.   If you have more than eight healthy records, Route 53 responds to different DNS resolvers with different combinations of healthy records.   When all records are unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight unhealthy records.   If a resource becomes unavailable after a resolver caches a response, client software typically tries another of the IP addresses in the response.   You can't create multivalue answer alias records.

You can optionally include a trailing dot. If you omit the trailing dot, Amazon Route 53 assumes that the domain name that you specify is fully qualified. This means that Route 53 treats www.example.com (without a trailing dot) and www.example.com. (with a trailing dot) as identical. For information about how to specify characters other than a-z, 0-9, and - (hyphen) and how to specify internationalized domain names, see DNS Domain Name Format in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

      * Creates, changes, or deletes a resource record set, which contains authoritative DNS information for a specified domain name or subdomain name. For example, you can use ChangeResourceRecordSets to create a resource record set that routes traffic for test.example.com to a web server that has an IP address of 192.0.2.44.  Change Batches and Transactional Changes  The request body must include a document with a ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest element. The request body contains a list of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered transactional changes. When using the Amazon Route 53 API to change resource record sets, Route 53 either makes all or none of the changes in a change batch request. This ensures that Route 53 never partially implements the intended changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone.  For example, a change batch request that deletes the CNAME record for www.example.com and creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. Route 53 deletes the first resource record set and creates the second resource record set in a single operation. If either the DELETE or the CREATE action fails, then both changes (plus any other changes in the batch) fail, and the original CNAME record continues to exist.  Due to the nature of transactional changes, you can't delete the same resource record set more than once in a single change batch. If you attempt to delete the same change batch more than once, Route 53 returns an InvalidChangeBatch error.   Traffic Flow  To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use either the traffic flow visual editor in the Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a traffic policy, then associate the traffic policy with one or more domain names (such as example.com) or subdomain names (such as www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back the updates if the new configuration isn't performing as expected. For more information, see Using Traffic Flow to Route DNS Traffic in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.  Create, Delete, and Upsert  Use ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest to perform the following actions:    CREATE: Creates a resource record set that has the specified values.    DELETE: Deletes an existing resource record set that has the specified values.    UPSERT: If a resource record set does not already exist, AWS creates it. If a resource set does exist, Route 53 updates it with the values in the request.     Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and Deleting Resource Record Sets  The syntax for a request depends on the type of resource record set that you want to create, delete, or update, such as weighted, alias, or failover. The XML elements in your request must appear in the order listed in the syntax.  For an example for each type of resource record set, see "Examples." Don't refer to the syntax in the "Parameter Syntax" section, which includes all of the elements for every kind of resource record set that you can create, delete, or update by using ChangeResourceRecordSets.   Change Propagation to Route 53 DNS Servers  When you submit a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, Route 53 propagates your changes to all of the Route 53 authoritative DNS servers. While your changes are propagating, GetChange returns a status of PENDING. When propagation is complete, GetChange returns a status of INSYNC. Changes generally propagate to all Route 53 name servers within 60 seconds. For more information, see GetChange.  Limits on ChangeResourceRecordSets Requests  For information about the limits on a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, see Limits in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

Change Batches and Transactional Changes  The request body must include a document with a ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest element. The request body contains a list of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered transactional changes. When using the Amazon Route 53 API to change resource record sets, Route 53 either makes all or none of the changes in a change batch request. This ensures that Route 53 never partially implements the intended changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone.  For example, a change batch request that deletes the CNAME record for www.example.com and creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. Route 53 deletes the first resource record set and creates the second resource record set in a single operation. If either the DELETE or the CREATE action fails, then both changes (plus any other changes in the batch) fail, and the original CNAME record continues to exist.  Due to the nature of transactional changes, you can't delete the same resource record set more than once in a single change batch. If you attempt to delete the same change batch more than once, Route 53 returns an InvalidChangeBatch error.   Traffic Flow  To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use either the traffic flow visual editor in the Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a traffic policy, then associate the traffic policy with one or more domain names (such as example.com) or subdomain names (such as www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back the updates if the new configuration isn't performing as expected. For more information, see Using Traffic Flow to Route DNS Traffic in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.  Create, Delete, and Upsert  Use ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest to perform the following actions:    CREATE: Creates a resource record set that has the specified values.    DELETE: Deletes an existing resource record set that has the specified values.    UPSERT: If a resource record set does not already exist, AWS creates it. If a resource set does exist, Route 53 updates it with the values in the request.     Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and Deleting Resource Record Sets  The syntax for a request depends on the type of resource record set that you want to create, delete, or update, such as weighted, alias, or failover. The XML elements in your request must appear in the order listed in the syntax.  For an example for each type of resource record set, see "Examples." Don't refer to the syntax in the "Parameter Syntax" section, which includes all of the elements for every kind of resource record set that you can create, delete, or update by using ChangeResourceRecordSets.   Change Propagation to Route 53 DNS Servers  When you submit a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, Route 53 propagates your changes to all of the Route 53 authoritative DNS servers. While your changes are propagating, GetChange returns a status of PENDING. When propagation is complete, GetChange returns a status of INSYNC. Changes generally propagate to all Route 53 name servers within 60 seconds. For more information, see GetChange.  Limits on ChangeResourceRecordSets Requests  For information about the limits on a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, see Limits in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

If you create a query logging configuration using the Route 53 console, Route 53 performs these operations automatically.    Create a CloudWatch Logs log group, and make note of the ARN, which you specify when you create a query logging configuration. Note the following:   You must create the log group in the us-east-1 region.   You must use the same AWS account to create the log group and the hosted zone that you want to configure query logging for.   When you create log groups for query logging, we recommend that you use a consistent prefix, for example:  /aws/route53/hosted zone name   In the next step, you'll create a resource policy, which controls access to one or more log groups and the associated AWS resources, such as Route 53 hosted zones. There's a limit on the number of resource policies that you can create, so we recommend that you use a consistent prefix so you can use the same resource policy for all the log groups that you create for query logging.     Create a CloudWatch Logs resource policy, and give it the permissions that Route 53 needs to create log streams and to send query logs to log streams. For the value of Resource, specify the ARN for the log group that you created in the previous step. To use the same resource policy for all the CloudWatch Logs log groups that you created for query logging configurations, replace the hosted zone name with *, for example:  arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/ *   You can't use the CloudWatch console to create or edit a resource policy. You must use the CloudWatch API, one of the AWS SDKs, or the AWS CLI.     Log Streams and Edge Locations  When Route 53 finishes creating the configuration for DNS query logging, it does the following:   Creates a log stream for an edge location the first time that the edge location responds to DNS queries for the specified hosted zone. That log stream is used to log all queries that Route 53 responds to for that edge location.   Begins to send query logs to the applicable log stream.   The name of each log stream is in the following format:   hosted zone ID/edge location code   The edge location code is a three-letter code and an arbitrarily assigned number, for example, DFW3. The three-letter code typically corresponds with the International Air Transport Association airport code for an airport near the edge location. (These abbreviations might change in the future.) For a list of edge locations, see "The Route 53 Global Network" on the Route 53 Product Details page.  Queries That Are Logged  Query logs contain only the queries that DNS resolvers forward to Route 53. If a DNS resolver has already cached the response to a query (such as the IP address for a load balancer for example.com), the resolver will continue to return the cached response. It doesn't forward another query to Route 53 until the TTL for the corresponding resource record set expires. Depending on how many DNS queries are submitted for a resource record set, and depending on the TTL for that resource record set, query logs might contain information about only one query out of every several thousand queries that are submitted to DNS.

      * Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for IPAddress.  If a health check already has a value for IPAddress, you can change the value. However, you can't update an existing health check to add or remove the value of IPAddress.    If you specify a value for IPAddress: Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header for all health checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you want Route 53 to perform health checks. When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the Host header:   If you specify a value of 80 for Port and HTTP or HTTP_STR_MATCH for Type, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.   If you specify a value of 443 for Port and HTTPS or HTTPS_STR_MATCH for Type, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.   If you specify another value for Port and any value except TCP for Type, Route 53 passes  FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port  to the endpoint in the Host header.   If you don't specify a value for FullyQualifiedDomainName, Route 53 substitutes the value of IPAddress in the Host header in each of the above cases.  If you don't specify a value for IPAddress: If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify in FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval you specify in RequestInterval. Using an IPv4 address that is returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.  If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName, the health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.  If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by FullyQualifiedDomainName, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).  In this configuration, if the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName matches the name of the resource record sets and you then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable.  In addition, if the value of Type is HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP_STR_MATCH, or HTTPS_STR_MATCH, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header, as it does when you specify a value for IPAddress. If the value of Type is TCP, Route 53 doesn't pass a Host header.

Using an IP address that is returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint. Use one of the following formats for the value of IPAddress:     IPv4 address: four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example, 192.0.2.44.    IPv6 address: eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345. You can also shorten IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example, 2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345.   If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for IPAddress. This ensures that the IP address of your instance never changes.
