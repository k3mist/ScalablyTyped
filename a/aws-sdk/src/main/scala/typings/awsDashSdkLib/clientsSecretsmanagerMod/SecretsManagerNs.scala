The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes it as the value for this parameter in the request. If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken yourself for the new version and include that value in the request.

We recommend that you generate a UUID-type value to ensure uniqueness of your versions within the specified secret.    If the ClientRequestToken value isn't already associated with a version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.

The following basic restrictions apply to tags:   Maximum number of tags per secret—50   Maximum key length—127 Unicode characters in UTF-8   Maximum value length—255 Unicode characters in UTF-8   Tag keys and values are case sensitive.   Do not use the aws: prefix in your tag names or values because it is reserved for AWS use. You can't edit or delete tag names or values with this prefix.

You provide the secret data to be encrypted by putting text in either the SecretString parameter or binary data in the SecretBinary parameter, but not both.

If you call an operation that needs to encrypt or decrypt the SecretString or SecretBinary for a secret in the same account as the calling user and that secret doesn't specify a AWS KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the account's default AWS managed customer master key (CMK) with the alias aws/secretsmanager. If this key doesn't already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the same AWS account automatically have access to use the default CMK.

If the secret is in a different AWS account from the credentials calling an API that requires encryption or decryption of the secret value then you must create and use a custom AWS KMS CMK because you can't access the default CMK for the account using credentials from a different AWS account. Store the ARN of the CMK in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by including it in the KMSKeyId. If you call an API that must encrypt or decrypt SecretString or SecretBinary using credentials from a different account then the AWS KMS key policy must grant cross-account access to that other account's user or role for both the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt operations.

    /**
      * Creates a new secret. A secret in Secrets Manager consists of both the protected secret data and the important information needed to manage the secret. Secrets Manager stores the encrypted secret data in one of a collection of "versions" associated with the secret. Each version contains a copy of the encrypted secret data. Each version is associated with one or more "staging labels" that identify where the version is in the rotation cycle. The SecretVersionsToStages field of the secret contains the mapping of staging labels to the active versions of the secret. Versions without a staging label are considered deprecated and are not included in the list. You provide the secret data to be encrypted by putting text in either the SecretString parameter or binary data in the SecretBinary parameter, but not both. If you include SecretString or SecretBinary then Secrets Manager also creates an initial secret version and automatically attaches the staging label AWSCURRENT to the new version.    If you call an operation that needs to encrypt or decrypt the SecretString or SecretBinary for a secret in the same account as the calling user and that secret doesn't specify a AWS KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the account's default AWS managed customer master key (CMK) with the alias aws/secretsmanager. If this key doesn't already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the same AWS account automatically have access to use the default CMK. Note that if an Secrets Manager API call results in AWS having to create the account's AWS-managed CMK, it can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result.   If the secret is in a different AWS account from the credentials calling an API that requires encryption or decryption of the secret value then you must create and use a custom AWS KMS CMK because you can't access the default CMK for the account using credentials from a different AWS account. Store the ARN of the CMK in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by including it in the KMSKeyId. If you call an API that must encrypt or decrypt SecretString or SecretBinary using credentials from a different account then the AWS KMS key policy must grant cross-account access to that other account's user or role for both the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt operations.       Minimum permissions  To run this command, you must have the following permissions:   secretsmanager:CreateSecret   kms:GenerateDataKey - needed only if you use a customer-managed AWS KMS key to encrypt the secret.

For more information about staging labels, see Staging Labels in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.  The staging labels that you specify in the VersionStage parameter are added to the existing list of staging labels--they don't replace it. You can move the AWSCURRENT staging label to this version by including it in this call.  Whenever you move AWSCURRENT, Secrets Manager automatically moves the label AWSPREVIOUS to the version that AWSCURRENT was removed from.  If this action results in the last label being removed from a version, then the version is considered to be 'deprecated' and can be deleted by Secrets Manager.  Minimum permissions  To run this command, you must have the following permissions:   secretsmanager:UpdateSecretVersionStage    Related operations    To get the list of staging labels that are currently associated with a version of a secret, use  DescribeSecret  and examine the SecretVersionsToStages response value.

If you use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDK to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes that in the request. If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken yourself for new versions and include that value in the request. You typically only need to interact with this value if you implement your own retry logic and want to ensure that a given secret is not created twice. We recommend that you generate a UUID-type value to ensure uniqueness within the specified secret.  Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during the Lambda rotation function's processing.   If the ClientRequestToken value isn't already associated with a version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.    If a version with this value already exists and that version's SecretString and SecretBinary values are the same as those in the request then the request is ignored (the operation is idempotent).    If a version with this value already exists and that version's SecretString and SecretBinary values are different from the request then an error occurs because you cannot modify an existing secret value.   This value becomes the VersionId of the new version.

The Secrets Manager console stores the information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs that the default Lambda rotation function knows how to parse. For storing multiple values, we recommend that you use a JSON text string argument and specify key/value pairs.

For example:  [{"username":"bob"},{"password":"abc123xyz456"}]  If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text. You can also 'escape' the double quote character in the embedded JSON text by prefacing each with a backslash. For example, the following string is surrounded by double-quotes. All of the embedded double quotes are escaped:  "[{\"username\":\"bob\"},{\"password\":\"abc123xyz456\"}]"
