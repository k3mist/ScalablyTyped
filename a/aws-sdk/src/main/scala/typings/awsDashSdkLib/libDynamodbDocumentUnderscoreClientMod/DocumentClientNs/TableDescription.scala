Backfilling occurs only when a new global secondary index is added to the table; it is the process by which DynamoDB populates the new index with data from the table. (This attribute does not appear for indexes that were created during a CreateTable operation.)    IndexName - The name of the global secondary index.    IndexSizeBytes - The total size of the global secondary index, in bytes. DynamoDB updates this value approximately every six hours. Recent changes might not be reflected in this value.     IndexStatus - The current status of the global secondary index:    CREATING - The index is being created.    UPDATING - The index is being updated.    DELETING - The index is being deleted.    ACTIVE - The index is ready for use.      ItemCount - The number of items in the global secondary index. DynamoDB updates this value approximately every six hours. Recent changes might not be reflected in this value.     KeySchema - Specifies the complete index key schema. The attribute names in the key schema must be between 1 and 255 characters (inclusive). The key schema must begin with the same partition key as the table.    Projection - Specifies attributes that are copied (projected) from the table into the index. These are in addition to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are automatically projected. Each attribute specification is composed of:    ProjectionType - One of the following:    KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary keys are projected into the index.    INCLUDE - Only the specified table attributes are projected into the index. The list of projected attributes are in NonKeyAttributes.    ALL - All of the table attributes are projected into the index.      NonKeyAttributes - A list of one or more non-key attribute names that are projected into the secondary index. The total count of attributes provided in NonKeyAttributes, summed across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 20. If you project the same attribute into two different indexes, this counts as two distinct attributes when determining the total.      ProvisionedThroughput - The provisioned throughput settings for the global secondary index, consisting of read and write capacity units, along with data about increases and decreases.    If the table is in the DELETING state, no information about indexes will be returned.

The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB' usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values. The sort key of an item is also known as its range attribute. The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.    For more information about primary keys, see Primary Key in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
