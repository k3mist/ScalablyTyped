To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not re-fire the same rule.

      * Adds the specified targets to the specified rule, or updates the targets if they are already associated with the rule. Targets are the resources that are invoked when a rule is triggered. You can configure the following as targets for CloudWatch Events:   EC2 instances   SSM Run Command   SSM Automation   AWS Lambda functions   Data streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams   Data delivery streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose   Amazon ECS tasks   AWS Step Functions state machines   AWS Batch jobs   AWS CodeBuild projects   Pipelines in AWS CodePipeline   Amazon Inspector assessment templates   Amazon SNS topics   Amazon SQS queues, including FIFO queues   The default event bus of another AWS account   Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the AWS Management Console. The built-in targets are EC2 CreateSnapshot API call, EC2 RebootInstances API call, EC2 StopInstances API call, and EC2 TerminateInstances API call.  For some target types, PutTargets provides target-specific parameters. If the target is a Kinesis data stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the KinesisParameters argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the RunCommandParameters field. To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon CloudWatch Events needs the appropriate permissions. For AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, CloudWatch Events relies on resource-based policies. For EC2 instances, Kinesis data streams, and AWS Step Functions state machines, CloudWatch Events relies on IAM roles that you specify in the RoleARN argument in PutTargets. For more information, see Authentication and Access Control in the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide. If another AWS account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using PutPermission), you can send events to that account. Set that account's event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To send the matched events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as the Arn value when you run PutTargets. If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event is not charged. For more information, see Amazon CloudWatch Pricing. If you are setting the event bus of another account as the target, and that account granted permission to your account through an organization instead of directly by the account ID, then you must specify a RoleArn with proper permissions in the Target structure. For more information, see Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS Accounts in the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide. For more information about enabling cross-account events, see PutPermission.  Input, InputPath, and InputTransformer are mutually exclusive and optional parameters of a target. When a rule is triggered due to a matched event:   If none of the following arguments are specified for a target, then the entire event is passed to the target in JSON format (unless the target is Amazon EC2 Run Command or Amazon ECS task, in which case nothing from the event is passed to the target).   If Input is specified in the form of valid JSON, then the matched event is overridden with this constant.   If InputPath is specified in the form of JSONPath (for example, $.detail), then only the part of the event specified in the path is passed to the target (for example, only the detail part of the event is passed).   If InputTransformer is specified, then one or more specified JSONPaths are extracted from the event and used as values in a template that you specify as the input to the target.   When you specify InputPath or InputTransformer, you must use JSON dot notation, not bracket notation. When you add targets to a rule and the associated rule triggers soon after, new or updated targets might not be immediately invoked. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect. This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same time. If that happens, FailedEntryCount is non-zero in the response and each entry in FailedEntries provides the ID of the failed target and the error code.

You can configure the following as targets for CloudWatch Events:   EC2 instances   SSM Run Command   SSM Automation   AWS Lambda functions   Data streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams   Data delivery streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose   Amazon ECS tasks   AWS Step Functions state machines   AWS Batch jobs   AWS CodeBuild projects   Pipelines in AWS CodePipeline   Amazon Inspector assessment templates   Amazon SNS topics   Amazon SQS queues, including FIFO queues   The default event bus of another AWS account   Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the AWS Management Console. The built-in targets are EC2 CreateSnapshot API call, EC2 RebootInstances API call, EC2 StopInstances API call, and EC2 TerminateInstances API call.  For some target types, PutTargets provides target-specific parameters. If the target is a Kinesis data stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the KinesisParameters argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the RunCommandParameters field. To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon CloudWatch Events needs the appropriate permissions. For AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, CloudWatch Events relies on resource-based policies. For EC2 instances, Kinesis data streams, and AWS Step Functions state machines, CloudWatch Events relies on IAM roles that you specify in the RoleARN argument in PutTargets. For more information, see Authentication and Access Control in the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide. If another AWS account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using PutPermission), you can send events to that account. Set that account's event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To send the matched events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as the Arn value when you run PutTargets. If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event is not charged. For more information, see Amazon CloudWatch Pricing. If you are setting the event bus of another account as the target, and that account granted permission to your account through an organization instead of directly by the account ID, then you must specify a RoleArn with proper permissions in the Target structure. For more information, see Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS Accounts in the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide. For more information about enabling cross-account events, see PutPermission.  Input, InputPath, and InputTransformer are mutually exclusive and optional parameters of a target. When a rule is triggered due to a matched event:   If none of the following arguments are specified for a target, then the entire event is passed to the target in JSON format (unless the target is Amazon EC2 Run Command or Amazon ECS task, in which case nothing from the event is passed to the target).   If Input is specified in the form of valid JSON, then the matched event is overridden with this constant.   If InputPath is specified in the form of JSONPath (for example, $.detail), then only the part of the event specified in the path is passed to the target (for example, only the detail part of the event is passed).   If InputTransformer is specified, then one or more specified JSONPaths are extracted from the event and used as values in a template that you specify as the input to the target.   When you specify InputPath or InputTransformer, you must use JSON dot notation, not bracket notation. When you add targets to a rule and the associated rule triggers soon after, new or updated targets might not be immediately invoked. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect. This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same time. If that happens, FailedEntryCount is non-zero in the response and each entry in FailedEntries provides the ID of the failed target and the error code.
