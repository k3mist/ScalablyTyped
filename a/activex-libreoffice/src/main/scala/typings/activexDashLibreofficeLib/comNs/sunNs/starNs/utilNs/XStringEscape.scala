/**
  * This interface is used to encode an arbitrary String into a escaped form.
  *
  * The escaped form is chosen to be suitable for use with other interfaces of the object or service providing this interface.
  *
  * Any characters or character sequences that are not compatible with any naming rules or restrictions must be replaced by an escaped form, that complies
  * to these rules.
  *
  * The transformation should preserve all traits of the string that are generally respected by the service. For example, the case of a string may be lost
  * after encoding and then decoding, if the service generally is case insensitive.
  *
  * Other than that the encoding is one-to-one and can be reversed. The encoding should try to preserve as much as possible of the original string, to
  * keep human-readable input human-friendly where possible. Strings that already conform to the naming conventions should be left unchanged or minimally
  * modified.
