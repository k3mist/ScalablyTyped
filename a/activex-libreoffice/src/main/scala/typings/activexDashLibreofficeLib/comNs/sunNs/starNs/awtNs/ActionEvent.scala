/**
  * a semantic event which indicates that a component-defined action occurred.
  *
  * This high-level event is generated by a component (such as a Button) when the component-specific action occurs (such as being pressed). The event is
  * passed to every {@link XActionListener} object that registered to receive such events using the component's `addActionListener` method.
  *
  * The object that implements the {@link XActionListener} interface gets this {@link ActionEvent} when the event occurs. The listener is therefore spared
  * the details of processing individual mouse movements and mouse clicks, and can instead process a "meaningful" (semantic) event like "button pressed".
