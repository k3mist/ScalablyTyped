  * transformation matrix, repeat mode, and transparency.
  *
  * To achieve uniformity, if this texture has a bitmap set, it is scaled in such a way that it will cover the same [0,1]x[0,1] box as the hatch and the
  * gradient. The transformation member can then be used to scale the complete texture as it fits suit.
