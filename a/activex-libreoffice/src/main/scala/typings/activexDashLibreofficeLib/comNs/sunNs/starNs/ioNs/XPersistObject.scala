/**
  * allows to make UNO objects persistent
  *
  * Every UNO object, that wants to be serializable, should implement this interface. The object stores stores itself, when the write method is called.
  *
  * The object needs to be created before it deserializes itself again (by using the read method). Therefore it must be creatable by name via a factory,
  * which is in general the global service manager. The create and read mechanism is implemented by the {@link com.sun.star.io.ObjectInputStream} .
  *
  * The serialization format (the series of strings, integers, objects) must be specified at the specification of the concrete service.
  *
  * The interface does not support any special versioning mechanism.
  * @see com.sun.star.io.XObjectOutputStream
  * @see com.sun.star.io.XObjectInputStream
