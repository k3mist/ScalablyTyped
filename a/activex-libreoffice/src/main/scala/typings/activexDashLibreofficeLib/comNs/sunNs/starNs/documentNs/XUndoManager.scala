/**
  * provides access to the undo/redo stacks of a document
  *
  * **Undo**
  *
  * Changes to a document usually result in recording of information how to undo those changes, if desired. A so-called undo action records the
  * information how to undo a single change. Undo actions are maintained in a stack, so that the changes they represent can be undo in the reverse order
  * they have originally been applied.
  *
  * **Redo**
  *
  * Additionally, the Undo manager manages a Redo stack: Actions which are undone are moved from the Undo to the Redo stack, so it is possible to re-apply
  * the changes to the document.
  *
  * **Undo contexts**
  *
  * For collecting multiple changes in a single undo action, so-called Undo contexts are provided. When an Undo context is entered, all subsequently added
  * Undo actions are not pushed onto the undo stack directly, but considered a sub action of the Undo context. Once the Undo context is left, a single
  * undo action is pushed onto the undo stack, which comprises all those single Undo actions. ;  Undo contexts can be arbitrarily nested.
  *
  * **Hidden Undo actions**
  *
  * Hidden Undo actions are those which in no observable way contribute to the undo stack. That is, any method retrieving information about the stack will
  * behave as if the undo action does not exist. Nonetheless, calling {@link undo()} respectively {@link redo()} will include those actions. ;  Hidden
  * Undo actions can be created by calling {@link enterHiddenUndoContext()} , following by {@link leaveUndoContext()} .
  *
  * **Locking**
  *
  * An Undo manager can be locked and unlocked, using the XLockable::lock() and XLockable::unlock() methods. When it is locked, then every attempt to add
  * an undo action, or to enter or leave an Undo context, will be silently ignored.
  * @since OOo 3.4
