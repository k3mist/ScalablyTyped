/**
  * This structure describes a text segment that is embedded in a larger portion of text. It is used for example by the {@link XAccessibleText} interface
  * to describe a text portion that was inserted into or deleted from an accessible text.
  *
  * The indices {@link TextSegment.SegmentStart} and {@link TextSegment.SegmentEnd} refer to the enclosing text. The {@link TextSegment.SegmentText}
  * member contains the text between these two indices including the start index but not the end index. With it you can use this structure without having
  * to access the {@link XAccessibleText} interface that represents the enclosing text.
  *
  * An empty text segment is expressed by {@link TextSegment.SegmentStart} and {@link TextSegment.SegmentEnd} set to the same value. While a value of -1
  * signals an error (like the request for a word after the last character of a text) all other values define the empty string at that position.
  *
  * The {@link SegmentText} member is a copy of the corresponding text segment of the enclosing text. Modifying this structure does not alter the
  * enclosing text.
  * @see XAccessibleText
  * @since OOo 1.1.2
