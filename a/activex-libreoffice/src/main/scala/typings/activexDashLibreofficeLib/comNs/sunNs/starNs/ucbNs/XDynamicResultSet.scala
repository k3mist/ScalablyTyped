/**
  * Provides read access to a {@link ContentResultSet} .
  *
  * You can either get a simple static {@link ContentResultSet} or you can listen to change-notifications and than swap from the old to a new {@link
  * ContentResultSet} .
  *
  * The following describes the dynamic use:
  *
  * {@link XDynamicResultSet} provides the possibility to get notifications about changes on a {@link ContentResultSet} and have an listener-controlled
  * update from one version to the next version. Two {@link ContentResultSet} implementations were given to the listener in the first notification as
  * interface {@link com.sun.star.sdbc.XResultSet} .
  *
  * To get notifications the listener has to be of type {@link XDynamicResultSetListener} .
  *
  * After registration you will get notifications for events of type {@link ListEvent} .
  *
  * The calling of {@link XDynamicResultSetListener.notify()} has to happen in an own thread, because it could take a longer time and any actions ???
  * until the listener returns the call. So don't block the notify-causing action.
  *
  * While one notify-call is going on:
  *
  *  1. The listener is allowed to access both ContentResultSets, they must be both valid. 2. It is not allowed to start a second notify-call. 3. All
  * additional things we want to send as notification are to be queued. 4. Any other calls are to be accepted and treated.
  *
  * After the listener has returned the notify-call:
  *
  *  1. The listener is allowed to access the new {@link ContentResultSet} . The new one is first assigned in the WELCOME-event and than the ResultSets
  * are always swapped. 2. The listener is not allowed to access the old {@link ContentResultSet} .
