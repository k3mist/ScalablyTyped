/**
  * provides access to a form based filter for a database form
  *
  * In a form based filter, form controls bound to a searchable database field are replaced with a control which allows entering a search expression. This
  * so-called **predicate expression** is basically a part of an SQL `WHERE` clause, but without the part denoting the database column. For instance, if
  * you have a form control bound to a table column named `Name` , then entering the string `LIKE 'Smith'` effectively constitutes a SQL `WHERE` clause
  * `"Name" LIKE 'Smith'` .
  *
  * In the actual document view, there are usually some relaxations to this. For instance, keywords such as `LIKE` might be localized, according to
  * OpenOffice.org's UI locale. Also, for an equality criterion, the equality sign `=` is usually omitted. However, this interface here provides
  * programmatic access to the form based filter, so those relaxations are not considered here.
  *
  * The filter maintained by a filter controller is, logically, a disjunctive normal form of an SQL `WHERE` class. That is, it is a disjunction of **m**
  * terms, where each term is a conjunction of **n** clauses of the form `<column> <predicate> <literal>` or of the form `<column> IS [NOT] NULL` .
  *
  * **n** equals the number of filter controls which the filter controller is responsible for. This number doesn't change during one session of the form
  * based filter. On the other hand, **m** , the number of disjunctive terms, is dynamic.
  *
  *
  *
  * With the above, there are potentially **m * n****predicate expressions** (though usually only a fraction of those will actually exist). Since in a
  * form based filter, there are only **n** filter controls, and each filter control displays exactly one **predicate expression** , this means that only
  * a part of the complete filter can be displayed, in particular, only one **disjunctive term** can be displayed at a time. Thus, the filter controller
  * knows the concept of an **active term** , denoted by the {@link ActiveTerm} attribute, controls which of the terms is currently displayed in the form
  * controls.
