/**
  * specifies a keyboard focus event.
  *
  * There are two levels of focus change events: permanent and temporary. Permanent focus change events occur when focus is directly moved from one
  * component to another, such as through calls to requestFocus() or as the user uses the Tab key to traverse components. Temporary focus change events
  * occur when focus is gained or lost for a component as the indirect result of another operation, such as window deactivation or a scrollbar drag. In
  * this case, the original focus state will automatically be restored once that operation is finished, or for the case of window deactivation, when the
  * window is reactivated. Both permanent and temporary focus events are delivered using the FOCUS_GAINED and FOCUS_LOST event ids; the levels may be
  * distinguished in the event using the isTemporary() method.
