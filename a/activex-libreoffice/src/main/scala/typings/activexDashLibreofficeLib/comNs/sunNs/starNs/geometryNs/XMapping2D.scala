/**
  * Interface defining an arbitrary bijective mapping from R^2 to R^2.
  *
  * This interface provides methods to define an arbitrary bijective mapping from R^2 to R^2, i.e. from the two-dimensional space of real numbers onto
  * itself, as is representable by the double floating point type. The mapping must be bijective, i.e. map a pair of real numbers to exactly one other
  * pair of real numbers an vice versa, to facilitate a working inverse. Bijectiveness also implies completeness, i.e. for every pair of real numbers
  * there must be another pair that is mapped upon them.
