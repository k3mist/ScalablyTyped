/**
  * This structure defines a 3 by 4 affine matrix.
  *
  * The matrix defined by this structure constitutes an affine mapping of a point in 3D to another point in 3D. The last line of a complete 4 by 4 matrix
  * is omitted, since it is implicitly assumed to be [0,0,0,1].
  *
  * An affine mapping, as performed by this matrix, can be written out as follows, where `xs, ys` and `zs` are the source, and `xd, yd` and `zd` the
  * corresponding result coordinates:
  *
  * ` xd = m00*xs + m01*ys + m02*zs + m03; yd = m10*xs + m11*ys + m12*zs + m13; zd = m20*xs + m21*ys + m22*zs + m23; `
  *
  * Thus, in common matrix language, with M being the {@link AffineMatrix3D} and vs=[xs,ys,zs]^T, vd=[xd,yd,zd]^T two 3D vectors, the affine
  * transformation is written as vd=M*vs. Concatenation of transformations amounts to multiplication of matrices, i.e. a translation, given by T, followed
  * by a rotation, given by R, is expressed as vd=R*(T*vs) in the above notation. Since matrix multiplication is associative, this can be shortened to
  * vd=(R*T)*vs=M'*vs. Therefore, a set of consecutive transformations can be accumulated into a single {@link AffineMatrix3D} , by multiplying the
  * current transformation with the additional transformation from the left.
  *
  * Due to this transformational approach, all geometry data types are points in abstract integer or real coordinate spaces, without any physical
  * dimensions attached to them. This physical measurement units are typically only added when using these data types to render something onto a physical
  * output device. For 3D coordinates there is also a projection from 3D to 2D device coordinates needed. Only then the total transformation matrix
  * (including projection to 2D) and the device resolution determine the actual measurement unit in 3D.
