    * returns the address of the Java Virtual Machine.

    * If the VM is not already instantiated, it will be now.
    *
    * If the `processID` is a normal 16-byte ID, the returned `any` contains a JNI `JavaVM` pointer as a `long` or `hyper` integer (depending on the
    * platform). If the `processID` does not match the current process, or if the VM cannot be instantiated for whatever reason, a `VOID``any` is returned.
    *
    * If the `processID` has an additional 17th byte of value  `0` , the returned `any` contains a non  -  reference-counted pointer to a
    * (reference-counted) instance of the C++ `jvmaccess::VirtualMachine` class, always represented as a `hyper` integer. The pointer is guaranteed to be
    * valid as long as the reference to this {@link com.sun.star.java.XJavaVM} is valid (but the pointer should be converted into a reference-counted
    * reference as soon as possible). Again, if the first 16 bytes of the `processID` do not match the current process, or if the VM cannot be instantiated
    * for whatever reason, a `VOID``any` is returned.
    *
    * If the `processID` has an additional 17th byte of value  `1` , the returned `any` contains a non  -  reference-counted pointer to a
    * (reference-counted) instance of the C++ `jvmaccess::UnoVirtualMachine` class, always represented as a `hyper` integer. The pointer is guaranteed to be
    * valid as long as the reference to this {@link com.sun.star.java.XJavaVM} is valid. Again, if the first 16 bytes of the `processID` do not match the
    * current process, or if the VM cannot be instantiated for whatever reason, a `VOID``any` is returned.
    *
    * The first form (returning a JNI `JavaVM` pointer) is mainly for backwards compatibility, new code should use the second form (returning a pointer to a
    * `jvmaccess::VirtualMachine` ) if it does not want to use the Java UNO environment, and it should use the third form (returning a pointer to a
    * `jvmaccess::UnoVirtualMachine` ) if it wants to use the Java UNO environment. For example, one advantage of using `jvmaccess::VirtualMachine` instead
    * of the raw `JavaVM` pointer is that whenever you attach a native thread to the Java virtual machine, that thread's context `ClassLoader` (see
    * `java.lang.Thread.getContextClassLoader` ) will automatically be set to a meaningful value.
    * @param processID The process ID of the caller's process, possibly extended by a 17th byte of value `0` or  `1` .
    * @returns On success, the `any` contains a pointer represented as `long` or `hyper` , otherwise the `any` is `VOID` .
