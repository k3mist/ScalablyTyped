/**
  * is the UNO representation of the Automation type `CY` , also know as `CURRENCY` .
  *
  * A `CY` could actually be represented as `hyper` in UNO and therefore a typedef from `hyper` to a currency type would do. But a typedef cannot be
  * expressed in all language bindings. In the case where no typedefs are supported the actual type is used. That is, a typedef'd currency type would be
  * represented as `long` in Java. The information that the `long` is a currency type is lost.
  *
  * When calling Automation objects from UNO the distinction between `hyper` and a currency type is important. Therefore {@link Currency} is declared as
  * struct.
