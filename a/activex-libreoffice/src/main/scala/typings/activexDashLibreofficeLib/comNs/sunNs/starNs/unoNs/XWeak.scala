/**
  * the server-side interface to a weak object.
  *
  * This interface is proxy to the adapted object. In order to make it possible to have weak references to objects, the {@link XAdapter} interface must be
  * implemented to provide a weak adapter for the clients.
  *
  * **Concept of weak referencing:**
  *
  * This module specifies the interfaces for implementing and using weak references.
  *
  * The sense of weak references is to hold a reference to an object without affecting the lifetime of the object. That means that a weak reference may
  * become invalid, at any time, if the referenced object dies.
  *
  * The following interfaces describe one way to handle weak references by providing a weak adapter. The weak object has to provide this adapter if anyone
  * wants to hold a weak reference. To separate their lifetimes, the adapter and the original object must not share the same reference counter. The weak
  * reference is in fact only a hard reference to the adapter, which knows - but does not hold - the original object. That means that the implementation
  * and synchronization of weak referencing is the responsibility of the object. The following interfaces are involved in the concept of weak referencing:
  *
  * **XWeak**: is the server-side interface of the referred object. This referred object must support the {@link XAdapter} interface.;
  *
  * **XReference**: is a client-side interface which must be implemented by the holder of any weak reference. It is used for notification when the adapted
  * object dies.;

    * It is important that the adapter must know, but not hold the adapted object. If the adapted object dies, all references to the adapter have to be
    * notified to release the adapter.
