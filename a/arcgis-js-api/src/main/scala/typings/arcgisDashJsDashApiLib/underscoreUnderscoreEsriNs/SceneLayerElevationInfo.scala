    * Defines how the graphic is placed with respect to the terrain surface. See the table below for a list of possible values.
    *
    * Mode | Description
    * ------|------------
    * on-the-ground | Graphics are draped on the terrain surface. This is the default value for features with [Point](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-geometry-Point.html) geometries rendered with [ObjectSymbol3DLayers](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-symbols-ObjectSymbol3DLayer.html).
    * relative-to-ground | The graphic is placed at an elevation relative to the terrain surface. The graphic's elevation is determined by summing up the terrain elevation, the `offset` value and the geometry's z-value (if present). This is the default value for [Point](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-geometry-Point.html) geometries rendered with [IconSymbol3DLayers](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-symbols-IconSymbol3DLayer.html).
    * absolute-height | Graphics are placed at an absolute elevation (z-value) above sea level. This z-value is determined by summing up the `offset` value and the geometry's z-value (if present). It doesn't take the elevation of the terrain into account. This is the default value for features with 3D Object geometries and [Point](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-geometry-Point.html) geometries where [hasZ](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-SceneLayer.html#hasZ) is `true`.
    * relative-to-scene | Graphics are aligned to buildings and other objects part of 3D Object [SceneLayer](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-SceneLayer.html) or [IntegratedMeshLayer](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-IntegratedMeshLayer.html), depending on which has higher elevation. If the graphic is not directly above a building or any other feature, it is aligned to the terrain surface elevation. If present, z-values will be ignored.
