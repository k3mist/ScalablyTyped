    * The address argument is data object that contains properties representing the various address fields accepted by the corresponding geocode service. These fields are listed in the addressFields property of the associated geocode service resource. For example, if the *addressFields* of a geocode service resource includes fields with the following names: Street, City, State and Zone, then the address argument is of the form:
    * ```js
    * {
    *   Street: "1234 W Main St",
    *   City: "Small Town",
    *   State: "WA",
    *   Zone: "99027"
    * }
    *
    * ```
    *
    * Locators published using ArcGIS 10 or later support a single line address field, which
    * can be specified using the following syntax where field_name is the name of the single
    * line address field. You can find this name by viewing the help or services directory for
    * your locator services. Common values are *SingleLine* and *SingleLineFieldName*:
    *
    * ```js
    * var address = { "field_name": "380 New York St, Redlands, CA 92373" };
    * ```
    * The Services Directory can be used to find out the required and optional address fields
    * and the correct names for the input name fields. If you are using the World Geocoding Service
    * visit the ArcGIS Online Geocoding Service help for more details on the World Geocoder.
