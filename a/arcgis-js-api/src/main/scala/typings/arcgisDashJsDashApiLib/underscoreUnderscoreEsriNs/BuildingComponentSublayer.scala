    * The SQL where clause used to filter features on the client. Only the features that satisfy the definition expression are displayed in the [View](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-View.html). Setting a definition expression is useful when only a subset of the data in the layer should be displayed.  Setting the definition expression of a layer automatically updates all layer views.  If the definition expression is set after the layer has been added to the map, the view will automatically refresh itself to display the features that satisfy the new definition expression.  Important to note is that the initial loading time of the features remains unchanged, even if they are filtered. This happens because, as opposed to Feature Layers, feature filtering is done client-side. As a result all features need to be downloaded always for filter evaluation.  This property is evaluated on the client using the cached attributes and it only supports [standardized SQL](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/sql-agol.htm).

See the [PopupTemplate sample](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/intro-popuptemplate/index.html) for an example of how [PopupTemplate](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-PopupTemplate.html) interacts with a [FeatureLayer](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-FeatureLayer.html). Setting a [PopupTemplate](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-PopupTemplate.html) on this layer type is done in the same way as a FeatureLayer.
