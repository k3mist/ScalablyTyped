    * on-the-ground | Graphics are draped on the terrain surface.

    * relative-to-ground | Graphics are placed at an elevation relative to the terrain surface. The graphic's elevation is determined by summing up the terrain elevation and the result of `featureExpressionInfo` (if defined). This is the default value for [Point](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-geometry-Point.html) geometries rendered with [IconSymbol3DLayers](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-symbols-IconSymbol3DLayer.html).
    * absolute-height | Graphics are placed at an absolute elevation (z-value) above sea level. This z-value is determined by the result of `featureExpressionInfo` (if defined). This mode doesn't take the elevation of the terrain into account.
    * relative-to-scene | Graphics are aligned to buildings and other objects part of 3D Object [SceneLayers](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-SceneLayer.html) or [IntegratedMeshLayers](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-IntegratedMeshLayer.html), depending on which has higher elevation. If the graphic is not directly above a building or any other feature, it is aligned to the terrain surface elevation. If defined, the result of `featureExpressionInfo` is added to the 3D Object/terrain surface elevation.
