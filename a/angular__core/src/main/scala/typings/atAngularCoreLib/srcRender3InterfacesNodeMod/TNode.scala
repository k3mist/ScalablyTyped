    * <child id="c1">content1</child>
    * <child id="c2"><span>content2</span></child>

    * ```
    * <ng-content id="cont1"></ng-content>
    * ```
    *
    * If `Array.isArray(projection)` then `TNode` is a host element:
    * - `projection` stores the content nodes which are to be projected.
    *    - The nodes represent categories defined by the selector: For example:
    *      `<ng-content/><ng-content select="abc"/>` would represent the heads for `<ng-content/>`
    *      and `<ng-content select="abc"/>` respectively.
    *    - The nodes we store in `projection` are heads only, we used `.next` to get their
    *      siblings.
    *    - The nodes `.next` is sorted/rewritten as part of the projection setup.
    *    - `projection` size is equal to the number of projections `<ng-content>`. The size of
    *      `c1` will be `1` because `<child>` has only one `<ng-content>`.
    * - we store `projection` with the host (`c1`, `c2`) rather than the `<ng-content>` (`cont1`)
    *   because the same component (`<child>`) can be used in multiple locations (`c1`, `c2`) and as
    *   a result have different set of nodes to project.
    * - without `projection` it would be difficult to efficiently traverse nodes to be projected.
    *
    * If `typeof projection == 'number'` then `TNode` is a `<ng-content>` element:
    * - `projection` is an index of the host's `projection`Nodes.
    *   - This would return the first head node to project:
    *     `getHost(currentTNode).projection[currentTNode.projection]`.
    * - When projecting nodes the parent node retrieved may be a `<ng-content>` node, in which case
    *   the process is recursive in nature (not implementation).
