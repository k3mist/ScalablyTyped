    *  - The array does not necessarily include all the political entities that contain an address,
    *    apart from those included in the `formatted_address`. To retrieve all the political entities
    *    that contain a specific address, you should use reverse geocoding, passing the latitude/longitude
    *    of the address as a parameter to the request.
    *  - The format of the response is not guaranteed to remain the same between requests.
    *    In particular, the number of `address_components` varies based on the address requested
    *    and can change over time for the same address. A component can change position in the array.
    *    The type of the component can change. A particular component may be missing in a later response.
