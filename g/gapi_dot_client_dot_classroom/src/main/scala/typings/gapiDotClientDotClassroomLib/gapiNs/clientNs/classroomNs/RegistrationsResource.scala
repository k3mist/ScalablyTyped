    * Returns the created `Registration`. Currently, this will be the same as

    * `id` filled in.
    *
    * Note that any value specified for the `expiry_time` or `id` fields will be

    * While Classroom may validate the `destination` and return errors on a best
    * effort basis, it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that it exists
    * and that Classroom has permission to publish to it.
    *
    * This method may return the following error codes:
    *
    * &#42; `PERMISSION_DENIED` if:
    * &#42; the authenticated user does not have permission to receive
    * notifications from the requested field; or
    * &#42; the credential provided does not include the appropriate scope for the
    * requested feed.
    * &#42; another access error is encountered.
    * &#42; `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if:
    * &#42; no `destination` is specified, or the specified `destination` is not
    * valid; or
    * &#42; no `feed` is specified, or the specified `feed` is not valid.
    * &#42; `NOT_FOUND` if:
    * &#42; the specified `feed` cannot be located, or the requesting user does not
    * have permission to determine whether or not it exists; or
    * &#42; the specified `destination` cannot be located, or Classroom has not
    * been granted permission to publish to it.
