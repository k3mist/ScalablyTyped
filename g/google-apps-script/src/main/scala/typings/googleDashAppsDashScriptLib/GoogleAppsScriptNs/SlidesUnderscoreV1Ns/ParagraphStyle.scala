// Styles that apply to a whole paragraph.
//
// If this text is contained in a shape with a parent placeholder, then these
// paragraph styles may be inherited from the parent. Which paragraph styles
// are inherited depend on the nesting level of lists:
//
// * A paragraph not in a list will inherit its paragraph style from the
//   paragraph at the 0 nesting level of the list inside the parent placeholder.
// * A paragraph in a list will inherit its paragraph style from the paragraph
//   at its corresponding nesting level of the list inside the parent
//   placeholder.
//
// Inherited paragraph styles are represented as unset fields in this message.
trait ParagraphStyle extends js.Object {
  // The text alignment for this paragraph.

  // LEFT_TO_RIGHT] since text direction is not inherited.
  var direction: ParagraphStyleTextDirection
  // The amount indentation for the paragraph on the side that corresponds to
  // the end of the text, based on the current text direction. If unset, the
  // value is inherited from the parent.

  // The amount of indentation for the start of the first line of the paragraph.
  // If unset, the value is inherited from the parent.
  var indent_first_line: Dimension
  // The amount indentation for the paragraph on the side that corresponds to
  // the start of the text, based on the current text direction. If unset, the
  // value is inherited from the parent.

  // is represented as 100.0. If unset, the value is inherited from the parent.

  // inherited from the parent.
