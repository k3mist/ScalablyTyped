/**
  * Represents work which is executed with a clean stack.
  *
  * Tasks are used in Zones to mark work which is performed on clean stack frame. There are three
  * kinds of task. [MicroTask], [MacroTask], and [EventTask].
  *
  * A JS VM can be modeled as a [MicroTask] queue, [MacroTask] queue, and [EventTask] set.
  *
  * - [MicroTask] queue represents a set of tasks which are executing right after the current stack
  *   frame becomes clean and before a VM yield. All [MicroTask]s execute in order of insertion
  *   before VM yield and the next [MacroTask] is executed.
  * - [MacroTask] queue represents a set of tasks which are executed one at a time after each VM
  *   yield. The queue is ordered by time, and insertions can happen in any location.
  * - [EventTask] is a set of tasks which can at any time be inserted to the end of the [MacroTask]
  *   queue. This happens when the event fires.
