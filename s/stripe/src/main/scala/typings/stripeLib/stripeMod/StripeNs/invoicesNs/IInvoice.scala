/**
  * Invoices are statements of what a customer owes for a particular billing period, including subscriptions,
  * invoice items, and any automatic proration adjustments if necessary. Once an invoice is created, payment
  * is automatically attempted. Note that the payment, while automatic, does not happen exactly at the time of
  * invoice creation. If you have configured webhooks, the invoice will wait until one hour after the last
  * webhook is successfully sent (or the last webhook times out after failing). Any customer credit on the
  * account is applied before determining how much is due for that invoice (the amount that will be actually
  * charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than 50 cents (the minimum for a charge), we add the
  * amount to the customer's running account balance to be added to the next invoice. If this amount is
  * negative, it will act as a credit to offset the next invoice. Note that the customer account balance does
  * not include unpaid invoices; it only includes balances that need to be taken into account when calculating
  * the amount due for the next invoice.
