    Sets rewrite method.  Valid values are:
    constant_score_auto - tries to pick the best constant-score rewrite
    method based on term and document counts from the query
    scoring_boolean - translates each term into boolean should and
    keeps the scores as computed by the query
    constant_score_boolean - same as scoring_boolean, expect no scores
    are computed.
    constant_score_filter - first creates a private Filter, by visiting
    each term in sequence and marking all docs for that term
    top_terms_boost_N - first translates each term into boolean should
    and scores are only computed as the boost using the top N
    scoring terms.  Replace N with an integer value.
    top_terms_N -   first translates each term into boolean should
    and keeps the scores as computed by the query. Only the top N
    scoring terms are used.  Replace N with an integer value.
    Default is constant_score_auto.
    This is an advanced option, use with care.
